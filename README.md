# tiny

An extension of MLTT that makes an arbitrary *ordinary type* 𝕋 tiny,
by giving (𝕋&nbsp;→&nbsp;-) a right adjoint √. This √ is necessarily
not a fibred right adjoint, but is made adjoint to a Fitch-style
context lock that represents (𝕋&nbsp;→&nbsp;-). There is no calculus
of explicit substitutions needed, and conjecturally the theory is
still normalising.

A 'global sections' modality ♭ is not necessary to state the defining
adjunction internally, we instead have the more general √((𝕋→A)→B) ≃ (A→√B).
